        <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with
          each other. When a person goes to a web page like
          www.google.com, their computer sends a
          <em>HTTP Request</em> to
          a <em>server</em>.
        </p>
          <p>
          The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
          it back to the user's computer where a <em>
          web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on
          the user's screen.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p> HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em>  HTML documents form the majority of content on the world wide web.</p>
        <p>HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describe <em>"what you see"</em> and <em>markup</em> which describes how it looks.  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This
          video</a> gives a good overview. </p>

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>HTML documents are made of HTML <em>elements</em>.  When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using a <em>tag</em>.  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a> explains the
          distinction well.

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>Often programmers say computers are stupid because they interepret commands literally.  This makes them very unforgiving as even the smallest mistake can cause a problem for a program.</p>

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.  Block elements form an <em>"invisible block</em> around the content inside of them.</p>

          <div class="concept-title">Developer Tools in the Browser</div>
          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>There are many different tools developers use when writing code for a browser.  Among them is <b>Sublime</b>, a program which allows developers to write their code and then open it in a browser to view their work.  There are many websites and programs like Sublime, and all will serve the same purpose.</p>

          <div class="concept-title">The "Tree-Like" Structure of HTML</div>
          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>The "tree-like" structure comes from the layout in which HTML elements can have other elements wrapped inside of them.  You can envision this relationship like a family tree.  Your father had multiple children, so did his father, and so on and so forth.</p>
            <p>In a browser, this relationship shows up as a series of <em>nested</em> boxes.  This essentially means there are boxes within boxes within boxes, and so on.</p>

          <div class="concept-title">The Relationship Between Indented HTML and Boxes</div>
          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document.  The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.</p>

          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>As discussed earlier, when writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime).  These editors make the programmers life easier.  For example, some editors will automatically generate a closing tag after an opening one.</p>

          <div class="concept-title">Avoiding Repetition</div>
          <div class="concept-description">
            <p><b>Avoiding Errors:</b> When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.
        </p>

        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
